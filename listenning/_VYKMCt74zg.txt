On test day, the IELTS Listening Test is on one digital audio track, which is started
by a supervisor and plays non-stop until it finishes approximately 30 minutes later.
This audio track contains the 4 listening sections,
but it also contains the instructions you will hear before, during and after each listening
section, given by the same speaker throughout the test.
The sample script below shows you these instructions. Remember that this is a script, you will not
see the script in the test, but you will hear these instructions.
Read through the script and move your mouse over the highlighted text to get important
advice.
